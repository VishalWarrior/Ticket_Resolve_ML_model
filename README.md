# Ticket_Resolve_ML_model
1-	Build a Clustering model using the sample data attached. Create cluster using “Ticket Summary” column.
2-	The solution should include text preprocessing including text cleaning, text to vector conversion. 
3-	Once the cluster is generated, assign a label to these cluster using NLP techniques. 
4-	After the labelling is done, build a Classification model using this clustering output where “Ticket Summary” will be your independent variable and “Cluster Label” will be 
     your target.
5-	Create an API for the prediction module, which takes “Ticket Summary” as an input and predict the “Cluster Label”.
6-	Along with the prediction the API should also return “Average time to resolve these ticket category”.
